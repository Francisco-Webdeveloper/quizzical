<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<img width="551" alt="Screenshot 2022-05-18 at 11 06 43" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67716187/169002442-4a9eee1c-1822-4785-992e-b31ba2ee0838.png">

This React app connects itself to the [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) and allows users to play a quiz game where, for each question, they can choose 1 out of the 4 answers displayed. In the end, the app will show the score, the correct answers and the ones the user failed.

### Built With
This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
* [Open Trivia DB API](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the following elements:
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```
* yarn
```sh
npm install yarn -g
```

### Installation

1. Get a free JSON API at [https://opentdb.com/api_config.php](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php). Use of this API does not require an API Key.
3. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone git@github.com:Francisco-Webdeveloper/sports-quiz.git
```
3. Install NPM packages
```sh
yarn install
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
